### What is this website?

The **Question pour un Piscineux** website is an online quiz platform specifically designed for participants of the 42 school piscine.

#### Website Description

**Question pour un Piscineux** aims to provide a competitive and fun environment for the **Heap** and **Stack** coalitions. This quiz tests the knowledge you have acquired during the piscine while reinforcing team spirit and camaraderie among participants.

Users can log in with their 42 credentials, participate in the quiz, and see their performance contribute to their coalition's score. Each correct answer earns points for their team, while each incorrect answer penalizes the remaining time. The goal is to answer as many questions correctly as possible within the given time frame, before the submission deadline.

The site is a fun initiative to mark the end of the intense piscine experience and to determine which coalition, **Heap** or **Stack**, will emerge victorious.

### Technical Section

This website is the first one I have deployed online. Through this project, I have gained valuable experience in several technical areas:

- **API Callbacks**: Developing this site allowed me to discover how API callbacks work. I implemented various API interactions to manage user data and quiz functionalities efficiently.
- **PHP and Database Deployment**: I learned how to deploy a website using PHP and set up a database on a VPS. This included configuring the server, securing the database, and ensuring smooth communication between the front-end and back-end components.

This project has been an invaluable learning experience, giving me hands-on knowledge in web development and deployment.
